## About me:

I am a 22-year-old engineering student in the JAMK University of Applied Sciences in the field of information and communication technology (ICT), specializing in data analytics and AI. I am actively looking for jobs and I want to increase my work experience. My hobbies include music and video games.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am very interested in both data-analytics and AI. In the future I plan on graduating as an ICT-engineer and improve in my field in the workforce. I work the most efficient solo, but I am also a fantastic team-player as I can explain myself efficiently and clearly. I am a fast learner.

### Skills:

Some of the stuff that I have worked with in school and hobbies include:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Pandas
- SQL
- Anaconda
- R
- HTML & CSS
- Powershell
- C & C++
- Linux
- AWS
- Microsoft Azure

### Career

I have not landed a job in the field of my study yet, but I have worked in retail, which has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork and communication, skills that are valuable in every field.

### Projects

#### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minecraft Wall Calculator:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This may seem like an odd little project, and it's not complex, I'll admit,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but it was spawned from a genuine need for a program that did exactly this functionality.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After unsuccessfully trying to find one online, I simply coded it from scratch, when I had barely any coding experience.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I still use it to this day.
